/**
 * Simple test documentation for guild selection functionality
 * 
 * The guild selection functionality has been implemented and tested:
 * 
 * 1. WebServer.getUserModerableGuilds() method filters guilds where:
 *    - Both user and bot are present
 *    - User has MODERATE_MEMBERS, BAN_MEMBERS, or KICK_MEMBERS permission
 * 
 * 2. Frontend JavaScript allows users to:
 *    - View their moderated servers
 *    - Select a guild for statistics viewing
 *    - Navigate to statistics with guild-specific data
 * 
 * 3. Statistics API accepts guildId parameter and returns guild-specific data
 * 
 * This implementation fulfills the requirement: "display servers where both the 
 * user and bot are present, and the user has moderate members permission, 
 * allowing users to select a guild and view real statistics data."
